# ChangeLog


## **V1.1.0**

The following breaking changes were made:
- submodules were just basically simplified/removed, all functions are just now {sport-league}.getXXX, eg. cfb.getTeamList() and no longer cfbTeams.getTeamList();
- support for statistics from stats.ncaa.com added, so you can get information on everything from men's ice-hockey to women's bowling.
- Documentation website created and updated
