# ChangeLog

## **V1.2.4**
- MLB functionality added by @unmonk (very grateful for the contribution!)
## **V1.2.0-2**
- Updated standings functions to be able to provide league-wide, conference and division for each applicable existing sport from ESPN.

## **V1.1.0**

The following breaking changes were made:
- submodules were just basically simplified/removed, all functions are just now {sport-league}.getXXX, eg. cfb.getTeamList() and no longer cfbTeams.getTeamList();
- support for statistics from stats.ncaa.com added, so you can get information on everything from men's ice-hockey to women's bowling.
- Documentation website created and updated
